EV424 Whitepaper — Integrity-Only Receipts
(Same Bytes → Same SHA-256)

Official Identity Statements (Scope-only)
1) EV424 treats unverifiable information as not eligible for truth claims.
2) EV424 must be independently re-verifiable without a trusted intermediary.
3) EV424 relies only on cryptographic integrity checks over bytes and reproducible receipts, not trust.

These identity statements declare scope only.
They are not gates, not pass criteria, and must not be cited as evidence.

Accuracy(4)=Truth(2)=Life(4)

Notice (Informative, Non-Evidence)
This document defines EV424’s integrity-only scope and terminology.
EV424 does not analyze content, does not judge truth, safety, or legality, and does not host or mirror original documents.

Public evidence is strictly limited to:
- OFFICIAL_URL (raw bytes source)
- FINGERPRINT_SHA256 (computed over the raw bytes)
- Re-verification method (e.g., sha256sum -c)
- Final receipt text (integrity-only summary)

No other statements, environments, logs, displays, or narratives constitute evidence.
