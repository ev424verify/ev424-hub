EV424 Whitepaper — Integrity-Only Receipts
(Same Bytes → Same SHA-256)

Official Identity Statements (Scope-only)
1) EV424 treats unverifiable information as not eligible for truth claims.
2) EV424 must be independently re-verifiable without a trusted intermediary.
3) EV424 relies only on cryptographic integrity checks over bytes and reproducible receipts, not trust.

These identity statements declare scope only.
They are not gates, not pass criteria, and must not be cited as evidence.

Accuracy(4)=Truth(2)=Life(4)

Notice (Informative, Non-Evidence)
This document defines EV424’s integrity-only scope and terminology.
EV424 does not analyze content, does not judge truth, safety, or legality, and does not host or mirror original documents.

Public evidence is strictly limited to:
- OFFICIAL_URL (raw bytes source)
- FINGERPRINT_SHA256 (computed over the raw bytes)
- Re-verification method (e.g., sha256sum -c)
- Final receipt text (integrity-only summary)

No other statements, environments, logs, displays, or narratives constitute evidence.
3. What EV424 is (and is not)
EN (Informative)
Is: non-custodial integrity proof + deterministic receipt + third-party reproducibility
Is not: truth/safety/legal/compliance assessment; content analysis; file hosting/mirroring

4. How it works (high-level)
EN (Informative)
EV424 follows a fixed 5-step sequence. The receipt records identity, check results, and a deterministic representative hash of the canonical receipt text.

5. Use cases
EN (Informative)
IR/ESG/official disclosures distribution integrity; audit/incident deliverables; AI provenance; standards/regulatory referencing verification.

6. Publication policy (plain-language)
EN (Informative)
PASS receipts may be public. FAIL receipts are not published. Optionally, after a dispute request is received, a minimal one-line notice may be published (not a receipt; no URLs, no hashes, no observables).

7. Link to Spec
EN (Informative)
Normative conformance rules live in the Spec.
