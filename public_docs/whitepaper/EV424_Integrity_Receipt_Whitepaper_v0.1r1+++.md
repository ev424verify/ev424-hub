TRACK B — WHITEPAPER (Informative, EN-only) — FINAL v0.1r1+++

1. Executive Summary
EN (Informative)
EV424 publishes an integrity-only receipt proving byte-level sameness (Same Bytes → Same SHA-256) for documents referenced by Official URLs. EV424 never hosts or mirrors originals and enables third-party re-verification using the receipt alone. PASS is printed only when all integrity gates and reproducibility requirements are satisfied; otherwise FAIL is observation only.

2. Why “sameness” matters
EN (Informative)
Distribution paths change. Audits, incidents, and provenance workflows often need a reproducible answer to: “Is this exactly the same file as the official snapshot?”—without judging what the content means.

3. What EV424 is (and is not)
EN (Informative)
Is: non-custodial integrity proof + deterministic receipt + third-party reproducibility
Is not: truth/safety/legal/compliance assessment; content analysis; file hosting/mirroring

4. How it works (high-level)
EN (Informative)
EV424 follows a fixed 5-step sequence. The receipt records identity, check results, and a deterministic representative hash of the canonical receipt text.

5. Use cases
EN (Informative)
IR/ESG/official disclosures distribution integrity; audit/incident deliverables; AI provenance; standards/regulatory referencing verification.

6. Publication policy (plain-language)
EN (Informative)
PASS receipts may be public. FAIL receipts are not published. Optionally, after a dispute request is received, a minimal one-line notice may be published (not a receipt; no URLs, no hashes, no observables).

7. Link to Spec
EN (Informative)
Normative conformance rules live in the Spec.
