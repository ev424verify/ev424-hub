Integrity-only (same-file check): EV424 reports file identity / integrity only (i.e., whether two files are the same bytes, verified via SHA-256).
EV424 does not judge truth/false, correctness, legality, medical validity, investment merit, safety, intent, or policy compliance.

Integrity ≠ Safety: A hash match proves same file, not that the file is “safe” or “correct.”
EV424 provides a reproducible method to confirm file identity, nothing more.

Reference = sealed fingerprint (time snapshot): EV424’s reference is the sealed SHA-256 fingerprint recorded at first registration (and its receipt/manifest chain).
This enables re-verification over time and helps detect changes across snapshots—without relying on “trust” alone.

No PDF mirroring: EV424 does not mirror or redistribute PDFs.
EV424 publishes only: official URL + SHA-256 fingerprint + re-verify method + reproducible receipt.

Non-affiliation: EV424 is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any issuing organization or listed entity.

1) How to Verify (Two Paths)

Path A (Most people):

Enter ENTRY_ID (e.g., EV424-ENTRY-000009) or PASS hash (64-hex) in Public Verify → view the Final Receipt.

Path B (Power users):

Re-download the PDF from the official URL, compute SHA-256 locally, and compare it to the sealed fingerprint shown in the receipt.

2) Finance (Not investment advice)

Q1. I received a financial report PDF—how can I confirm it’s the same file as the referenced original?
A. EV424 is not investment advice; it performs an integrity / same-file check only.
A. Compare SHA-256 against the sealed fingerprint in the Final Receipt (ENTRY_ID / PASS hash).

Q2. Same title/date, but I suspect different versions are circulating.
A. EV424 does not judge “latest/correct”; it confirms file identity only.
A. Re-download from the official URL and verify the SHA-256 matches the receipt fingerprint.

Q3. Someone shared a “official” PDF—should I trust it?
A. EV424 does not assess trustworthiness; it checks same bytes only.
A. Use the receipt fingerprint as the reference and confirm your file matches.

3) AI (Model outputs / citations)

Q1. An AI cited a PDF—how do I confirm the cited file matches the official source?
A. EV424 does not validate the AI’s claims; it verifies same-file integrity only.
A. Download from the official URL and compare SHA-256 to the receipt’s sealed fingerprint.

Q2. The link is the same, but AI answers changed—did the document change?
A. EV424 cannot explain why; it can confirm whether the file is identical or changed.
A. Compare the current file’s SHA-256 to the sealed fingerprint stored in the receipt.

Q3. Can EV424 tell if a document is “up to date”?
A. EV424 doesn’t judge “up to date”; it checks file identity only.
A. Use official publication metadata for currency, and use SHA-256 to confirm file sameness.

4) Medical (Not medical advice)

Q1. I want to confirm a medical guideline PDF is the same file as the official publication.
A. EV424 is not medical advice; it performs an integrity / same-file check only.
A. Verify the SHA-256 matches the sealed fingerprint shown in the Final Receipt.

Q2. I’m worried a circulated PDF was edited or altered.
A. EV424 doesn’t judge medical correctness; it checks file identity only.
A. Re-download from the official URL and confirm the SHA-256 matches the receipt fingerprint.

Q3. Can EV424 tell me what to do medically?
A. No. EV424 provides integrity evidence only—medical decisions require proper professional guidance.
A. Use EV424 solely to confirm file sameness via SHA-256 and the receipt.

5) Sports

Q1. Is this rulebook PDF exactly the same file as the official one?
A. EV424 doesn’t interpret rules; it verifies same-file integrity only.
A. Compare your file’s SHA-256 to the receipt fingerprint (ENTRY_ID / PASS hash).

Q2. Community copies are everywhere—how do I avoid mixed versions?
A. EV424 doesn’t pick the “right” version; it confirms identical bytes only.
A. Choose the official URL as your source and verify SHA-256 against the receipt.

Q3. Same name, different contents—what now?
A. EV424 can’t decide which is “correct”; it can show whether files are the same or different.
A. Use SHA-256 comparisons to map which copy matches the sealed fingerprint.

6) Weather (Reports)

Q1. I want to confirm a weather/climate report PDF matches the official file.
A. EV424 doesn’t forecast or interpret; it verifies file identity only.
A. Re-verify using the Final Receipt fingerprint as the sealed reference.

Q2. The URL stayed the same, but the report might have been updated.
A. EV424 can’t explain updates; it can detect changes across snapshots via SHA-256.
A. Compare the current SHA-256 to the sealed fingerprint recorded at first registration.

Q3. Can EV424 tell me tomorrow’s weather?
A. No. EV424 is integrity-only, not a prediction tool.
A. Use EV424 only to confirm document sameness via receipt/sha256.

7) Space (Research / technical PDFs)

Q1. How do I confirm a technical PDF is exactly the same file as the official repository version?
A. EV424 doesn’t evaluate research quality; it verifies same-file integrity only.
A. Compare SHA-256 to the sealed fingerprint shown in the Final Receipt.

Q2. Multiple mirrors exist—how do I avoid confusion?
A. EV424 won’t rank sources; it verifies identical bytes only.
A. Use the official URL, then match SHA-256 to the receipt fingerprint.

Q3. Does EV424 prove the research is “true”?
A. No. EV424 proves file identity only (integrity), not truth/validity.
A. Use the receipt for reproducible integrity checks and evaluate claims separately.

8) Companies (Policies / filings)

Q1. How can I confirm a corporate policy/filing PDF matches the official publication?
A. EV424 doesn’t assess corporate risk; it performs a same-file check only.
A. Verify SHA-256 against the sealed fingerprint in the Final Receipt.

Q2. Someone sent me a “company official PDF”—what should I do?
A. EV424 doesn’t judge intent; it verifies file identity only.
A. Re-download from the official URL and confirm SHA-256 matches the receipt.

Q3. Is EV424 affiliated with any issuer?
A. No. EV424 is not affiliated/endorsed/sponsored by any issuing organization.
A. EV424 references publicly available documents only and reports integrity evidence.
